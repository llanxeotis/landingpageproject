# landingpageproject
First project for web development specialisation on udacity.

## description
An extremely simple landing page with only one image, functions include a scroll-to-section and a navigation bar.

## disclaimer
Some functions were not easy to get to work, some do not work at all (added in the code but do not cause any errors). The project was started 7 days before the deadline, as the 14 days before that were used to thoroughly understand and practise the concepts, and therefore there has been a lot of trial and error during the making of the project.
